            directory path is already created and the application has permission
            to write and read at the specified location.
            You can specify a full path or a relative path based on the location
            of this file "websearch.xml". To define a relative path, start with a
            period ("."). To back out of the directory, use ("../").
            Example:
                full: z:/home/websearch/indexes  or  /home/websearch/indexes
                reative: ./indexes  or  ../indexes  or  ../../indexes 
        -->
        <indexURI>../search/main</indexURI>

            keep the crawler from indexing links outside of your site. 
            Can have multiple scopes
