        <!-- Name of the index. This can be anything you want.

            directory path is already created and the application has permission
            to write and read at the specified location.
            You can specify a full path or a relative path based on the location
            of this file "websearch.xml". To define a relative path, start with a
            period ("."). To back out of the directory, use ("../").
            Example:
                full: z:/home/websearch/indexes  or  /home/websearch/indexes
                reative: ./indexes  or  ../indexes  or  ../../indexes 
        -->
        <indexURI>./websearch/main</indexURI>

        <!-- The scope that the crawer will stay in. Put your servers domain to 
            keep the crawler from indexing links outside of your site. 
            Can have multiple scopes
        -->
        <scope>http://localhost:8080</scope>
